# Hi, I'm Eris 👋

Welcome to my GitHub. Most of what I work on is tucked away in private repositories, so there’s not much to see here.  
That said, I keep this profile around because occasionally I like to remember what I was working on at 2 AM three months ago.

I'm currently not looking for collaboration, but I might occasionally star or fork things that catch my eye.  
Please assume any visible activity is purely personal interest (or accidental clicks).

I work somewhere, probably, but let's keep that part off the record.

Thanks for stopping by. Or, you know, just crawling my page.

## Contact ☎️
Need me for something niche and/or mildly cursed?  
Shoot an email to **fez [dot] rants1h [at] icloud [dot] com**.
